# This file contains all the inputs that the script calcSpec.jl needs to calculate an expected diagnostic
# signal for a specific diagnostic. It also executes the script calcSpec.jl after the inputs are defined.
# Please also read the description in calcSpec.jl for further input information.
# The inputs are as follows:
#
# batch_job - If true, the script assumes that it will be executed via an HPC batch job. The script will act accordingly. - Bool
# distributed - If true, parallel computing with multiple CPU cores will be used. - Bool
# numOcores - The number of CPU cores that will be used if distributed is set to true. - Int64
#
# addNoise - If set to true, the script will add noise to the synthetic signal, defined by input variables noiseLevel_b and _s. - Bool
# diagnostic_filepath - The filepath to the geometry-data for the diagnostic for which to calculate the synthetic signal. If not specified, spherical emission is assumed - String
# diagnostic_name - The name of the diagnostic for which to compute the synthetic signal. Purely for esthetic purposes- String
# Ed_min - The lower bound for the diagnostic energy grid (measurement grid) - Float64
# Ed_max - The upper bound for the diagnostic energy grid (measurement grid) - Float64
# Ed_diff - The width of the diagnostic energy bins (PLEASE NOTE! THIS WILL INDIRECTLY DEFINE THE NUMBER OF DIAGNOSTIC ENERGY GRID POINTS.) - Float64
# filepath_equil - The path to the .eqdsk-file (or .geqdsk/.jld2-file) with the tokamak magnetic equilibrium and geometry - String
# filepath_FI_distr - The path to the fast-ion distribution file to extract tokamak/fast-ion data from. Must be .cdf, .h5 or .jld2 file format - String
# filepath_FI_TRANSP_shot - The path to the TRANSP .cdf fast-ion file, if filepath_FI_distr or filepath_thermal_distr is specified as a .cdf TRANSP file. If so, should be same as filepath_FI_distr - String
# filepath_thermal_distr - The path to the thermal plasma distribution file. Must be .cdf (TRANSP) or .jld2 file format. Otherwise "" - String
# filepath_TRANSP_shot - The path to the TRANSP .cdf shot file, if filepath_FI_distr or filepath_thermal_distr is specified as a .cdf TRANSP file - String
# folderpath_o - The path to the folder where the results will be saved - String
# mc_samples - The number of Monte-Carlo samples to use for the signal computation (sample from the fast-ion distribution) - Int64
# mc_chunk - The number of Monte-Carlo samples in a single sample-partitioned chunk - Int64
# noiseLevel_b - The level of the background noise for the synthetic signal, if addNoise is set to true - Float64
# noiseLevel_s - The level of the signal noise for the synthetic signal, if addNoise is set to true - Float64
# folderpath_OWCF - The script needs to know where it is located. Yup, I know. A little bit awkward isn't it? - String
# reaction - The nuclear fusion reaction that you want to simulate. Please see OWCF/misc/availReacts.jl for available fusion reactions - String
# calcProjVel - If true, then the synthetic diagnostic spectrum will be the result of projected fast-ion velocities. Remember to set 'reaction' to 'proj-X' where 'X' is the fast-ion species which projected velocity you want to compute - Bool
# timepoint - The timepoint of the tokamak shot for the magnetic equilibrium. Format XX,YYYY where XX are seconds and YYYY are decimals - String
# thermal_temp_axis - The temperature of the thermal plasma distribution on axis, if filepath_thermal_distr is not specified - Float64
# thermal_dens_axis - The density of the thermal plasma distribution on axis, if filepath_thermal_distr is not specified - Float64
# verbose - If true, lots of information will be printed during execution. Fun! - Boolean
# visualizeProgress - If false, progress bar will not be displayed during computations - Boolean
#
# If you have specified a .h5 or .jld2 fast-ion distribution file, you can ask to have it interpolated
# so as to have the grid resolution of your choice. This can be good for investigating how grid resolution
# affects the resulting synthetic signal. The extra inputs are as follows:
# interp - If true, then the loaded fast-ion distribution will be interpolated - Boolean
# nE_ps - The energy grid resolution after interpolation - Int64
# np_ps - The pitch grid resolution after interpolation - Int64
# nR_ps - The R grid resolution after interpolation - Int64
# nz_ps - The z grid resolution after interpolation - Int64

# If you want, you can also manually specify a tokamak. Only for esthetic purposes. It is
# not necessary to specify and might be overwritten anyway. The input is as follows:
# tokamak - The tokamak in which the diagnostic and fast-ion distribution is located - String

### Other
# Please note, when specifying files (distribution files etc.) finish the path without '/'.
# When specifying folders (folderpath_o etc.) finish the path with '/'.
# In short, finish path to files without '/'. Finish path to folder with '/'.
#
# Also, please note, that if you specify a TRANSP .cdf file, regardless of it being thermal or fast-ion (FI),
# you must also specify the other TRANSP .cdf file with filepath_TRANSP_shot/filepath_FI_TRANSP_shot.
# Further info below at the variable specifications. If no TRANSP .cdf files have been specified both
# for filepath_FI_distr and filepath_thermal_distr, then filepath_TRANSP_shot and filepath_FI_TRANSP_shot
# can remain unspecified. Why this complicated scheme of file specification? Because if a TRANSP .cdf
# file has been specified, the algorithm needs to know the fast-ion time window to extract data from.
# That is only stored in the TRANSP .cdf fast-ion file
