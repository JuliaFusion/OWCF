# This file contains all the inputs that the script calcOrbWeights.jl needs to compute orbit weight functions. That is, weight functions that map of the sensitivity 
# of (fast-ion) diagnostics in terms of (drift) orbits. In other words, orbit weight functions quantify how sensitive a fast-ion diagnostic is to different fast-ion 
# drift orbits. After the inputs are defined, this template file also executes the script calcOrbWeights.jl. The computed orbit weight functions will be two-dimensional 
# and have dimensions (channels, valid orbits) where 'channels' is ((Ed_max-Ed_min)/Ed_diff)-1 and 'valid orbits' is the number of valid orbits for the orbit grid for 
# which the orbit weight functions have been computed. Please see list of inputs below for explanation of variables.

# The inputs are as follows:
#
# batch_job_SLURM - If true, the script assumes that it will be executed as part of an high-performance computational 
#                   cluster batch job within the SLURM cluster environment. The script will act accordingly. - Bool
# distributed - If true, parallel computing with multiple CPU cores will be used. - Bool
# folderpath_OWCF - The path to the OWCF folder - String
# numOcores - The number of CPU cores that will be used if distributed is set to true. - Int64
#
# analytic - If true, the orbit weight functions will be computed using the analytic equations in A. Valentini et al. Nucl. Fusion, Submitted (2025).
#              Please note! This is an approximation, in which the thermal population is assumed to be at rest. However, using these analytic equations, 
#              no Monte Carlo methods are necessary, i.e. massive speed-up of computations - Bool
# debug - If true, then the script will run in debug-mode. Should almost always be set to false - Bool
# diagnostic_filepath - The path to the LINE21 data diagnostic line-of-sight file. Leave as "" for assumed sperical emission - String
# diagnostic_name - The name of the diagnostic. Purely for esthetic purposes - String
# instrumental_response_filepath - The path to three .txt-files or one .jld2-file, containing the necessary data for representing 
#                                the instrumental response of the diagnostic. If paths to three .txt-files are specified, they should 
#                                be specified together in a vector of three strings. That is,
#                                
#                                instrumental_response_filepath = ["/path/to/response/matrix.txt","/path/to/particle/inputs.txt","/path/to/diagnostic/outputs.txt"]
#
#                                The first string is the filepath to the response matrix. The size of the matrix is 'ni x no', where 'ni' is the number of diagnostic input 
#                                grid points and 'no' is the number of output (actually being measured) grid points. The second string is the filepath to the input grid 
#                                points (vector). The third string is the filepath to the output grid points (vector). So, for example, for a proton recoil diagnostic, 
#                                the input should be incoming neutron energies (keV) and the output could be proton impact positions (e.g. cm). If, instead, the path to one 
#                                .jld2 file is specified, it should be specified as 
#
#                                instrumental_response_filepath = "/path/to/diagnostic/response/data.jld2"
#
#                                The keys of the .jld2-file should then be "response_matrix", "input" and "output". Input data should be a vector of length 'ni', output 
#                                data should be a vector of length 'no' and response_matrix should be a matrix of size 'ni x no'.
# instrumental_response_output_units - The units of measurement of the output grid points specified via the output in the 'instrumental_response_filepath' input variable.
#                                      Please see the OWCF/misc/convert_units.jl script for a list of all acceptable units in the OWCF - String

# folderpath_o - The path to the folder where the results will be saved - String
# iiimax - If specified to be greater than 1, several copies of weight functions will be calculated. For comparison. - Int64
# inclPrideRockOrbs - If true, then counter-stagnation (pride-rock) orbits will be included. Otherwise, minimum(Rm) = magnetic axis by default - Bool
# include2Dto4D - If true, then (in addition) the 2D orbit weight functions will be enflated to their 4D form (channels,nE,npm,nRm) and saved in the folderpath_o folder as well - Bool
# include_FLR_effects - If set to true, finite Larmor radius effects will be taken into account when computing the weight function(s) - Bool
# n_gyro - The number of points by which to (randomly, uniform sampling) discretize the gyro-motion of the guiding-centre into - Int64

# nRm - The number of fast-ion Rm grid points in orbit space - Int64
