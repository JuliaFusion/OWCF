################################ start_calcOW_template.jl #########################################
# This file contains all the inputs that the script calcOrbWeights.jl needs to calculate orbit
# weight functions. This file also executes the script calcOrbWeights.jl after the inputs are defined.
# The computed orbit weight functions will be two-dimensional and have dimensions (channels, valid orbits)
# where 'channels' is ((Ed_max-Ed_min)/Ed_diff)-1 and 'valid orbits' is the number of valid orbits for
# the orbit grid for which the orbit weight functions have been computed.

# The inputs are as follows:
#
# batch_job - If true, the script assumes that it will be executed via an HPC batch job. The script will act accordingly. - Bool
# distributed - If true, parallel computing with multiple CPU cores will be used. - Bool
# folderpath_OWCF - The path to the OWCF folder - String
# numOcores - The number of CPU cores that will be used if distributed is set to true. - Int64
#
# analyticalOWs - If set to true, projected velocities will be used to compute the orbit weight functions. In that case, no thermal data is needed - Bool
# debug - If true, then the script will run in debug-mode. Should almost always be set to false - Bool
# diagnostic_filepath - The path to the LINE21 data diagnostic line-of-sight file. Leave as "" for assumed sperical emission - String
# diagnostic_name - The name of the diagnostic. Purely for esthetic purposes - String
# instrumental_response_filepath - The path to three .txt-files or one .jld2-file, containing the necessary data for representing 
#                                the instrumental response of the diagnostic. If paths to three .txt-files are specified, they should 
#                                be specified together in a vector of three strings. That is,
#                                
#                                instrumental_response_filepath = ["/path/to/response/matrix.txt","/path/to/particle/inputs.txt","/path/to/diagnostic/outputs.txt"]
#
#                                The first string is the filepath to the response matrix. The size of the matrix is 'ni x no', where 'ni' is the number of diagnostic input 
#                                grid points and 'no' is the number of output (actually being measured) grid points. The second string is the filepath to the input grid 
#                                points (vector). The third string is the filepath to the output grid points (vector). So, for example, for a proton recoil diagnostic, 
#                                the input should be incoming neutron energies (keV) and the output could be proton impact positions (e.g. cm). If, instead, the path to one 
#                                .jld2 file is specified, it should be specified as 
#
#                                instrumental_response_filepath = "/path/to/diagnostic/response/data.jld2"
#
#                                The keys of the .jld2-file should then be "response_matrix", "input" and "output". Input data should be a vector of length 'ni', output 
#                                data should be a vector of length 'no' and response_matrix should be a matrix of size 'ni x no'.
# instrumental_response_output_units - The units of measurement of the output grid points specified via the output in the 'instrumental_response_filepath' input variable.
#                                      Please see the OWCF/misc/convert_units.jl script for a list of all acceptable units in the OWCF - String
# Ed_min - The lower boundary for the diagnostic energy grid (measurement grid) - Float64
# Ed_max - The upper boundary for the diagnostic energy grid (measurement grid) - Float64
# Ed_diff - The width of the diagnostic energy bins (PLEASE NOTE! THIS WILL INDIRECTLY DEFINE THE NUMBER OF DIAGNOSTIC ENERGY GRID POINTS.) - Float64
# E_array - The fast-ion energy (keV) grid points of your (E,pm,Rm) grid. If set to 'nothing': nE, Emin and Emax must be specified - Vector
# Emin - The lower boundary for the fast-ion energy in orbit space - Float64
# Emax - The upper boundary for the fast-ion energy in orbit space - Float64
# filepath_equil - The path to the file with the tokamak magnetic equilibrium and geometry - String
# filepath_FI_cdf - Can be specified, if filepath_thermal_distr is a TRANSP .cdf shot file. See below for specifications - String
# filepath_thermal_distr - The path to the thermal distribution file to extract thermal species data from. Must be TRANSP .cdf, .jld2 file format or "" - String
# folderpath_o - The path to the folder where the results will be saved - String
# iiimax - If specified to be greater than 1, several copies of weight functions will be calculated. For comparison. - Int64
# inclPrideRockOrbs - If true, then pride-rock/pinch orbits will be included. Otherwise, minimum(Rm) = magnetic axis by default - Bool
# include2Dto4D - If true, then (in addition) the 2D orbit weight functions will be enflated to their 4D form (channels,nE,npm,nRm) and saved in the folderpath_o folder as well - Bool
# nE - The number of fast-ion energy grid points in orbit space - Int64
# npm - The number of fast-ion pm grid points in orbit space - Int64
# nRm - The number of fast-ion Rm grid points in orbit space - Int64
# og_filepath - The path to a .jld2 file containing the output of the calcOrbGrid.jl script. If specified, the values of E_array, pm_array, Rm_array, nE, npm, nRm, Emin, pm_min, Rm_min, Emax, pm_max and Rm_max won't matter. Leave as 'nothing' to use them instead - String
# pm_array - The fast-ion pm grid points of your (E,pm,Rm) grid. If set to 'nothing': npm, pm_min and pm_max must be specified - Vector
# pm_min - The lower boundary for the orbit-grid pm values - Float64
# pm_max - THe upper boundary for the orbit-grid pm values - Float64
# reaction - The nuclear fusion reaction that you want to simulate. Please see OWCF/misc/availReacts.jl for available fusion reactions - String
# Rm_array - The fast-ion Rm grid points of your (E,pm,Rm) grid. If set to 'nothing': nRm, Rm_min and Rm_max must be specified - Vector
# Rm_min - The lower boundary for the orbit-grid Rm values - Float64
# Rm_max - The upper boundary for the orbit-grid Rm values - Float64
# timepoint - The timepoint of the tokamak shot for the magnetic equilibrium. Format XX,YYYY where XX are seconds and YYYY are decimals - String
# thermal_temp_axis - The temperature of the thermal species distribution on axis, if filepath_thermal_distr is not specified - Float64
# thermal_dens_axis - The density of the thermal species distribution on axis, if filepath_thermal_distr is not specified - Float64
# verbose - If true, lots of information will be printed during execution - Bool
# visualizeProgress - If false, progress bar will not be displayed during computations - Bool
#
# extra_kw_args - Here you can define extra keyword arguments to be used when integrating the equations-of-motion
# for the guiding-center orbits. Please consult the OWCF manual for further info on this.

### Other
# If filepath_thermal_distr is not specified, then an interpolation object will be
# used as 'analytical' thermal temperature and thermal density profiles, respectively. The thermal_temp_axis
# and thermal_dens_axis variables will be used to scale the polynomial profiles to match the specified
# thermal temperature and thermal density at the magnetic axis. Please see the /misc/temp_n_dens.jl script for info.
