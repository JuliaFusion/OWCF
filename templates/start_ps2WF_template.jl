################################ start_ps2WF_template.jl #########################################
# This file contains all the inputs that the script ps2WF.jl needs to calculate ultra-high
# resolution orbit weight function signals for a given diagnostic. If calcWFOs is set to true, the 
# ps2WF.jl script will also compute orbit splits of the diagnostic signal, fast-ion distribution,
# orbit weight functions and signal density. This can be visualized using e.g. signalWebApp.jl.
# This file also executes the script ps2WF.jl after the inputs are defined.

# The inputs are as follows:
#
# batch_job - If true, the script assumes that it will be executed via an HPC batch job. The script will act accordingly. - Bool
# distributed - If true, parallel computing with multiple CPU cores will be used. - Bool
# folderpath_OWCF - The path to the OWCF folder - String
# numOcores - The number of CPU cores that will be used if distributed is set to true. - Int64
#
# calcWFOs - If true, then the algorithm will compute the WF densities in orbit format. PLEASE NOTE! Takes extra RAM memory - Bool
# diagnostic_filepath - The path to the LINE21 data diagnostic line-of-sight file. Leave as "" for assumed sperical emission - String
# diagnostic_name - The name of the diagnostic. Purely for esthetic purposes - String
# Ed_min - The lower bound for the diagnostic energy grid (signal/measurement grid) - Float64
# Ed_max - The upper bound for the diagnostic energy grid (signal/measurement grid) - Float64
# Ed_diff - The width of the diagnostic energy bins (PLEASE NOTE! THIS WILL INDIRECTLY DEFINE THE NUMBER OF DIAGNOSTIC ENERGY GRID POINTS.) - Float64
# E_array - If specified, the ps2WF.jl will use the values in this array as the energy grid points in its (E,pm,Rm) grid. extrema(E_array) should be within extrema(E) where 'E' are the energy grid points of f(E,p,R,z) - Array{Float64,1}
# Emin - The lower bound for the fast-ion energy in orbit space, if E_array is left unspecified. Emin > minimum(E) should be respected, where 'E' are the energy grid points of f(E,p,R,z) - Float64
# Emax - The upper bound for the fast-ion energy in orbit space, if E_array is left unspecified. Emax < maximum(E) should be respected, where 'E' are the energy grid points of f(E,p,R,z) - Float64
# filepath_equil - The path to the .eqdsk-file (or .geqdsk/.jld2-file) with the tokamak magnetic equilibrium and geometry - String
# filepath_FI_distr - The path to the fast-ion distribution file to extract tokamak/fast-ion data from. Must be .h5 or .jld2 file format - String
# filepath_FI_TRANSP_shot - The path to the TRANSP .cdf fast-ion file, if filepath_thermal_distr is specified as a .cdf TRANSP file - String
# filepath_thermal_distr - The path to the thermal species distribution file. Must be .cdf (TRANSP) or .jld2 file format. Otherwise "" - String
# folderpath_o - The path to the folder where the results will be saved - String
# h5_is_rowmajor - If the 'filepath_FI_distr' file is an .h5/.hdf5 file and it was saved using a row-major programming language (e.g. C/C++ or 
#                  NumPy in Python, please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order for more info), this input variable 
#                  should be set to true - Bool
# inclPrideRockOrbs - If true, then pride-rock/pinch orbits will be included. Otherwise, minimum(Rm) = magnetic axis by default - Bool
# nE - The number of fast-ion energy grid points in orbit space, if E_array is left unspecified - Int64
# nEbatch - The batch size of your energy grid in orbit space. Must be <= nE - Int64
# npm - The number of fast-ion pm grid points in orbit space, if pm_array is left unspecified - Int64
# nRm - The number of fast-ion Rm grid points in orbit space, if Rm_array is left unspecified - Int64
# pm_array - If specified, the ps2WF.jl will use the values in this array as the pm grid points in its (E,pm,Rm) grid - Array{Float64,1}
# pm_min - The lower boundary for the orbit-grid pitch values - Float64
# pm_max - THe upper boundary for the orbit-grid pitch values - Float64
# reaction - The nuclear fusion reaction that you want to simulate. Please see OWCF/misc/availReacts.jl for available fusion reactions - String
# Rm_array - If specified, the ps2WF.jl will use the values in this array as the Rm grid points in its (E,pm,Rm) grid - Array{Float64,1}
# Rm_min - The lower boundary for the orbit-grid maximum major radius grid points. Only used if specified together with Rm_max - Float64
# Rm_max - The upper boundary for the orbit-grid maximum major radius grid points. Only used if specified together with Rm_min - Float64
# timepoint - The timepoint of the tokamak shot for the magnetic equilibrium. Format XX,YYYY where XX are seconds and YYYY are decimals - String
# thermal_dens_axis - The density of the thermal species distribution on axis, if filepath_thermal_distr is not specified - Float64
# thermal_temp_axis - The temperature of the thermal species distribution on axis, if filepath_thermal_distr is not specified - Float64
# visualizeProgress - If false, progress bar will not be displayed during computations - Boolean
# verbose - If true, lots of information will be printed during execution - Boolean
#
# You can also specify the tokamak if you want. It is purely for esthetic purposes, and might be overwritten anyway.
# tokamak - The tokamak for which the WF signal is computed - String
#
# extra_kw_args - Here you can define extra keyword arguments to be used when integrating the equations-of-motion
# for the guiding-center orbits. Please consult the OWCF manual for further info on this.

### Other
# Please note, when specifying files (distribution files etc.) finish the path without '/'.
# When specifying folders (folderpath_o etc.) finish the path with '/'.
#
# Also, please note, that if you specify a TRANSP .cdf file for the thermal distribution,
# you must also specify another TRANSP .cdf file with filepath_FI_TRANSP_shot.
# Further info below at the variable specifications. If no TRANSP .cdf file has been specified
# for filepath_thermal_distr, then filepath_FI_TRANSP_shot can remain unspecified.
# Why this complicated scheme of file specification? Because if a TRANSP .cdf
# file has been specified, the algorithm needs to know the fast-ion time window to extract data from.
# That is only stored in the TRANSP .cdf fast-ion file
