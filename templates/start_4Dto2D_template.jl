# This file contains all the inputs that the script orbWeights_4Dto2D.jl needs to compress the 4D inflated form
# of orbit weight functions into their compressed 2D form. This file also executes the script
# orbWeights_4Dto2D.jl after the inputs are defined. The inputs are as follows:
#
# batch_job_SLURM - If true, the script assumes that it will be executed as part of an high-performance computational 
#                   cluster batch job within the SLURM cluster environment. The script will act accordingly. - Bool
# distributed - If true, parallel computing with multiple CPU cores will be used. - Bool
# numOcores - The number of CPU cores that will be used if distributed is set to true. - Int64
#
# diagnostic - The diagnostic of the orbit weights - String
# filepath_equil - The path to the .eqdsk-file (or .geqdsk/.jld2-file) with the tokamak magnetic equilibrium and geometry - String
# filepath_W - The path to the .jld2 weights file, containing orbit weights to be compressed - String
# folderpath_OWCF - The path to the OWCF folder - String
# FI_species - The ion species for which the orbit weights are computed. E.g. "D", "T" etc. See misc/species_func.jl for further info - String
# timepoint - The timepoint of the tokamak shot for the magnetic equilibrium. Format XX,YYYY where XX are seconds and YYYY are decimals - String
# tokamak - The tokamak of the orbit weights - String
# TRANSP_id - The TRANSP id to extract tokamak/equilibrium data from - String
# verbose - If set to true, the script will talk a lot - Bool
#
# extra_kw_args - Here you can define extra keyword arguments to be used when integrating the equations-of-motion
# for the guiding-center orbits. Please consult the OWCF manual for further info on this.
