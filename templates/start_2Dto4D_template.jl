# This file contains all the inputs that the script orbWeights_2Dto4D.jl needs to inflate the 2D compact form
# weight matrix into its inflated 4D form. This file also executes the script
# orbWeights_2Dto4D.jl after the inputs are defined. The inputs are as follows:
#
# batch_job - If true, the script assumes that it will be executed via an HPC batch job. The script will act accordingly. - Bool
# distributed - If true, parallel computing with multiple CPU cores will be used. - Bool
# folderpath_OWCF - The path to the OWCF folder - String
# numOcores - The number of CPU cores that will be used if distributed is set to true. - Int64
#
# diagnostic_name - The name of the diagnostic of the orbit weights (esthetic) - String
# Ed_energies - Can be type Nothing, Int64 or Array{Float64,1}. 
#   # Nothing  - If Ed_energies is specified as 'nothing', all orbit weight functions (all diagnostic energy bins)
#                will be transformed from 1D to 3D. They will be put together into a 4D matrix.
#   # Int64 - If Ed_energies is specified as an Int64 (for example '10'), the algorithm will transform that many
#                orbit weight functions from 1D to 3D. They will be (approximately) evenly spaced across all diagnostic energy bins.
#                If Ed_energies is specified as an Int64, it cannot be greater than half of the number of rows of the weight matrix.
#                For example, if the weight matrix has 80 rows (diagnostic energy bins), then Ed_energies must be <= 40.
#                Continuing the example, if Ed_energies is specified as '10', then the orbit weight functions corresponding to 
#                weight matrix rows 1, 9, 17, 25, 33, 41, 49, 57, 65, 73 will be transformed from 1D to 3D, and then put 
#                together into a 4D matrix.
#   # Array{Float64,1} - If Ed_energies is specified as an Array{Float64,1}, the algorithm will attempt to find the 
#                diagnostic energy bins with the values closest to the values in Ed_energies. If several values are close 
#                to the same diagnostic energy bin, no duplicates will be produced (the weight function will be transformed only once).  
# filepath_equil - The path to the .eqdsk-file/.jld2-file with the tokamak magnetic equilibrium and geometry - String
# filepath_W - The path to the .jld2 weights file, containing orbit weights to be enflated - String
# FI_species - The ion species for which the orbit weights are computed. E.g. "D", "T" etc. See misc/species_func.jl for further info - String
# timepoint - The timepoint of the tokamak shot for the magnetic equilibrium. Format XX,YYYY where XX are seconds and YYYY are decimals - String
# tokamak - The tokamak of the orbit weights - String
# TRANSP_id - The TRANSP id to extract tokamak/equilibrium data from - String
# verbose - If set to true, the script will talk a lot! - Bool
#
# extra_kw_args - Here you can define extra keyword arguments to be used when integrating the equations-of-motion
# for the guiding-center orbits. Please consult the OWCF manual for further info on this.
