# This file contains all the inputs that the script os2com.jl needs to transform an orbit weight
# function matrix from (E,pm,Rm) coordinates to (E,mu,Pphi;alpha) coordinates. This can also be 
# achieved by simply utilizing the os2COM() function in extra/dependencies.jl. However, this script
# let's you avoid having to think about it, and just does it for you. It also works with topological
# maps or boundarie, as well as poloidal and toroidal transit times, and null orbits.
#
# batch_job - If true, the script assumes that it will be executed via an HPC batch job. The script will act accordingly. - Bool
# distributed - If true, parallel computing with multiple CPU cores will be used. - Bool
# numOcores - The number of CPU cores that will be used if distributed is set to true. - Int64
#
# filepath_equil - The path to the magnetic equilibrium file (.eqdsk/.geqdsk/.jld2 file format) - String
# filepath_Q - The path to the 3D or 4D (E,pm,Rm) orbit-space quantity - String
# folderpath_o - The path to the folder in which you want the os2com.jl outputs - String
# folderpath_OWCF - The path to where the OWCF-folder is saved on your computer - String
# nmu - The number of gridpoints in magnetic moment - Int64
# nPphi - The number of gridpoints in toroidal canonical angular momentum - Int64
# timepoint - The timepoint of the tokamak shot for the magnetic equilibrium. Format XX,YYYY where XX are seconds and YYYY are decimals - String
# tokamak - The name of the tokamak. If unknown, leave as "" - String
# verbose - If set to true, the os2com.jl script will talk a lot! - String
# FI_species - The fast-ion species. E.g. "D", "T", "3he", "alpha" etc - String
# 
# extra_kw_args - Here you can define extra keyword arguments to be used when integrating the equations-of-motion
# for the guiding-center orbits. Please consult the OWCF manual for further info on this.
