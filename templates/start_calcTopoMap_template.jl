#### Description:
# This script contains all the inputs for the calcTopoMap.jl script. It defines the computational
# environment (batch job, cores etc), loads the inputs and then executes the calcTopoMap.jl script.
# The inputs are as follows:
#
# batch_job_SLURM - If true, the script assumes that it will be executed as part of an high-performance computational 
#                   cluster batch job within the SLURM cluster environment. The script will act accordingly. - Bool
# distributed - If true, parallel computing with multiple CPU cores will be used. - Bool
# folderpath_OWCF - The path to the OWCF folder - String
# numOcores - The number of CPU cores that will be used if distributed is set to true. - Int64
#
# distinguishIncomplete - If true, then incomplete orbits will be given integer 6 instead of 9.
# distinguishLost - If true, then lost orbits will be given integer 7 instead of 9.
# filepath_equil - The path to the .eqdsk-file (or .geqdsk/.jld2-file) with the tokamak magnetic equilibrium and geometry - String
# filepath_OG - The path to the .jld2 file containing the output of calcOrbGrid.jl - String
# filepath_W - The path to the .jld2/.h5/.hdf5 weights file to extract orbit grid info from - String
# folderpath_o - The path to the folder where the results will be saved - String
# includeExtractTopoBounds - If true, then the topological boundaries will be computed as well - Bool
# keyname_diagHDF5 - The HDF5 key identifier with which to load the weights file. if !(weightsFileJLD2). The 'E_array', 'pm_array' and 'Rm_array' key identifiers will be assumed for the orbit-space grid points - String
# saveTransitTimeMaps - If true, the output .jld2 file will also contain two 3D array, both of size(orbit grid), with poloidal and toroidal transit times for the valid orbits - Bool
# timepoint - The timepoint of the tokamak shot for the magnetic equilibrium. Format "XX,YYYY" where XX are seconds and YYYY are decimals - String
# tokamak - The tokamak for which the topological map is created - String
# TRANSP_id - The TRANSP id to extract tokamak/equilibrium data from - String
# verbose - If true, lots of information will be printed during execution - Bool
# visualizeProgress - If false, progress bar will not be displayed during computations - Bool
# weightsFileJLD2 - If true, it is assumed that the weights file is in JLD2 format - Bool

# Then, there are inputs that only need to be specified if (!isfile(filepath_W) && !isfile(filepath_OG)):
# E_array - If you want, you can manually specify a vector of fast-ion energies for which to compute the topological map - Array{Float64,1}
# FI_species - The fast-ion particle species that the topological map is to be computed for - String
# pm_array - If you want, you can manually specify a vector of pitch maximum values for which to compute the topological map - Array{Float64,1}
# Rm_array - If you want, you can manually specify a vector of radius maximum values for which to compute the topological map - Array{Float64,1}

# Then, there are inputs that only need to be specified if E_array, pm_array and/or Rm_array are set to nothing:
# Emin - The lower bound for the fast-ion energy in orbit space. if (!isfile(filepath_W) && !isfile(filepath_OG)) - Float64
# Emax - The upper bound for the fast-ion energy in orbit space. if (!isfile(filepath_W) && !isfile(filepath_OG)) - Float64
# inclPrideRockOrbs - If true, then pride rock (counter-stagnation) orbits will be included
# nE - The number of fast-ion energy grid points in orbit space. if (!isfile(filepath_W) && !isfile(filepath_OG)) - Int64
# npm - The number of fast-ion pm grid points in orbit space. if (!isfile(filepath_W) && !isfile(filepath_OG)) - Int64
# nRm - The number of fast-ion Rm grid points in orbit space. if (!isfile(filepath_W) && !isfile(filepath_OG)) - Int64
# pm_min - The lower bound for the pitch maximum in orbit space - Float64
# pm_max - The upper bound for the pitch maximum in orbit space - Float64
# Rm_min - The lower boundary for the orbit-grid Rm values - Float64
# Rm_max - The upper boundary for the orbit-grid Rm values - Float64
#
# extra_kw_args - Here you can define extra keyword arguments to be used when integrating the equations-of-motion
# for the guiding-center orbits. Please consult the OWCF manual for further info on this.

#### Outputs
# -

#### Saved files
# topoMap_[tokamak]_[TRANSP ID]_[FI species]_[timestamp]_[nE]x[npm]x[nRm].jld2
#   This saved file will have the fields:

#   pm_array - The fast-ion pm grid array used for orbit space - Array{Float64,1}
#   Rm_array - The fast-ion Rm grid array used for orbit space - Array{Float64,1}
# And if saveTransitTimeMaps was set to true, the saved file will also have the fields:
#   polTransTimes - The poloidal transit times for all valid orbits. Dimensions are size(orbit grid) - Array{Float64,3}
#   torTransTimes - The toroidal transit times for all valid orbits. Dimensions are size(orbit grid) - Array{Float64,3}
