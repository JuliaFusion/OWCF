# This file contains all the inputs needed by the script ps2os.jl. Copy this file, and change
# inputs accordingly. After reading the inputs, the script will execute ps2os.jl. As of this version
# of the OWCF, the ps2os.jl script will use Monte-Carlo sampling to transform from (E,p,R,z) to 
# (E,pm,Rm). In future version, other methods of transforming are planned to be selectable.
#
### The inputs are:
#
# batch_job - If true, the script assumes that it will be executed via an HPC batch job. The script will act accordingly. - Bool
# distributed - If true, parallel computing with multiple CPU cores will be used. - Bool
# folderpath_OWCF - The path to the OWCF folder - String
# numOcores - The number of CPU cores that will be used if distributed is set to true. - Int64
#
# include1Dto3D - If true, then the 3D OS FI distribution will be saved as well - Boolean
# filepath_distr - The path to the fast-ion distribution file to extract tokamak/fast-ion data from. Must be .h5 or .jld2 file format - String
# filepath_equil - The path to the .eqdsk-file (or .geqdsk/.jld2-file) with the tokamak magnetic equilibrium and geometry - String
# filepath_W - The path to the weights file to use as blueprint for the orbit grid. If desired. - String
# filepath_OG - The path to the output file from calcOrbGrid.jl. If specified, ps2os.jl will use that as the (E,pm,Rm) grid points - String
# flip_F_EpRz_pitch - If true, then the FI PS distribution will be mirrored in pitch - Boolean
# folderpath_o - Path to folder where you want your results. End with '/' (or '\' if Windows...) - String'
# numOsamples - The number of orbit samples you want. The more, the better the transform. But takes longer to compute! - Int64
# nbatch - The algorithm will save the progress every nbatch sample. Useful if the sampling gets cancelled unexpectedly - Int64
# os_equidistant - If true, script assumes equidistant orbit grid. False not supported yet - Boolean
# timepoint - The timepoint of the tokamak shot for the magnetic equilibrium. Format XX,YYYY where XX are seconds and YYYY are decimals - String
# tokamak - The tokamak for which the topological map is created - String
# TRANSP_id - The TRANSP id to extract tokamak/equilibrium data from - String
# useWeightsFile - If true, ps2os.jl will use filepath_W to load info to create orbit grid - Boolean
# useOrbGridFile - If true, ps2os.jl will use filepath_OG to load into to create orbit grid - Boolean
# verbose - If true, lots of outputs will be printed during script execution - Boolean
# visualizeProgress - If true, then progress bar will be shown. Good for local calcs. Bad for clusters. - Boolean
#
## Then there are input variables that you only need to specify is you set useWeightsFile/useOrbGridFile to false:
# Emin - The lower bound for the fast-ion energy in orbit space - Float64
# Emax - The upper bound for the fast-ion energy in orbit space - Float64
# FI_species - The particle species of the fast-ion distribution. E.g. "D", "T", "3he" etc - String
# inclPrideRockOrbs - If true, then pride rock (counter-stagnation) orbits will be included
# nE - The number of fast-ion energy grid points in orbit space - Int64
# npm - The number of fast-ion pm grid points in orbit space - Int64
# nRm - The number of fast-ion Rm grid points in orbit space - Int64
# pm_min - The lower bound for the pitch maximum in orbit space - Float64
# pm_max - The upper bound for the pitch maximum in orbit space - Float64
# Rm_min - The lower boundary for the orbit-grid Rm values - Float64
# Rm_max - The upper boundary for the orbit-grid Rm values - Float64
#
## Then, finally, you could specify to have the fast-ion interpolated onto a coarser/finer
# (E,p,R,z) grid before transforming it (via sampling) to orbit space. This is useful to 
# test robustness and the effect of grid resolution etc. The inputs are as follows
# interp - If set to true, the algorithm will interpolate the loaded fast-ion distribution - Bool
# nE_ps - The number of fast-ion energy grid points in particle space to interpolate onto - Int64
# np_ps - The number of fast-ion pitch grid points in particle space to interpolate onto - Int64
# nR_ps - The number of fast-ion R grid points in particle space to interpolate onto - Int64
# nz_ps - The number of fast-ion z grid points in particle space to interpolate onto - Int64

# By particle space (ps), we mean the guiding-center (E,p,R,z) four-dimensional space
