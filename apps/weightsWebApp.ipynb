    "## Description:\n",
    "This notebook provides an application to visualize orbit weight functions in an interactive and\n",
    "intuitive manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "It visualizes orbit weight functions as a function of orbit space (E,pm,Rm) coordinates.\n",
    "Since the orbit weight functions are three-dimensional, fast-ion energy (E) slices \n",
    "are visualized. The fast-ion energy can be changed via an interactive slider to easily \n",
    "scroll through different fast-ion energies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights (delta function signals) that make up the orbit weight functions can also be \n",
    "visualized. This is done via the 'show_delta_signal' button in the web application. To be clear, in addition to having the web application help the user to visualize W[Ed,E,:,:] (where 'W' is the orbit weight function, 'Ed' is a specific diagnostic signal measurement bin center and 'E' is a specific fast-ion energy), this 'show_delta_signal' button allows the user to visualize W[:,E,pm,Rm] where 'pm' is a specific pitch maximum and 'Rm' is a specific major radius maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to running this notebook, please make sure you have run the following OWCF scripts:\n",
    "- calcOrbWeights.jl (or equivalent)\n",
    "- extractTopoBounds.jl\n",
    "- orbWeights_2Dto4D.jl (if not automatically in calcOrbWeights.jl)\n",
    "And that you have noted the paths to the output files. You will also (partially) need the following: \n",
    " - An .eqdsk or .jld2 file containing tokamak magnetic equilibrium and geometry\n",
    " - An .hdf5 or .jld2 file with synthetic/experimental signal (please see script further down for specs)\n",
    " \n",
    "Note! The OWCF has several fast-ion diagnostic sightline models already built-in. Please see the OWCF/vc_data/ folder for all the readily available diagnostic sightline models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing, the user can also choose to specify the path to a file containing data for a \n",
    "fast-ion orbit-space distribution. The same orbit grid as the weight functions is required. In that case, the app will show a 2D slice (constant fast-ion energy) of the fast-ion distribution, and of the non-integrated WF density, along with everything else. Please consult the OWCF manual for further info.\n",
    "\n",
    "All energy slices are visualized with Rm on the x-axis and pm on the y-axis by default. This can be switched to the toroidal canonical angular momentum and magnetic moment via a toggle button in the app.\n",
    "### PLEASE NOTE! \n",
    "It is recommended to ensure that the orbit weights and the topological boundaries\n",
    "have exactly the same dimensions and ranges, by using the orbit weights to calculate the \n",
    "topological map in calcTopoMap.jl (set useWeightsFile to true) in the first place.\n",

    "For orbit-space grids containing more than approximately 150 000 valid orbits (e.g. 20x100x100), you should NOT use weightsWebApp.ipynb (or any other OWCF notebook).
