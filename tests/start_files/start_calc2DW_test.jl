################################ start_calc2DW_test.jl #########################################
# This file contains all the inputs that the script calc2DWeights.jl needs to calculate 2D (E,p)
# weight functions. This file also executes the script calc2DWeights.jl after the inputs are defined.
# The computed 2D weight functions will be three-dimensional and have dimensions (nEd, nE, np)
# where nEd is the number of diagnostic measurement bins, nE is the number of energy grid points and
# np is the number of pitch grid points.

# The inputs are as follows:
#
# batch_job - If true, the script assumes that it will be executed via an HPC batch job. The script will act accordingly. - Bool
# distributed - If true, parallel computing with multiple CPU cores will be used. - Bool
# folderpath_OWCF - The path to the OWCF folder - String
# numOcores - The number of CPU cores that will be used if distributed is set to true. - Int64
#
# analytical2DWs - If set to true, projected velocities will be used to compute the weight functions. In that case, no thermal data is needed - Bool
# debug - If true, then the script will run in debug-mode. Should almost always be set to false - Bool
# diagnostic_filepath - The path to the LINE21 data diagnostic line-of-sight file. Leave as "" for assumed sperical emission - String
# diagnostic_name - The name of the diagnostic. Purely for esthetic purposes - String
# instrumental_response_filepath - The path to three .txt-files or one .jld2-file, containing the necessary data for representing 
#                                the instrumental response of the diagnostic. If paths to three .txt-files are specified, they should 
#                                be specified together in a vector of three strings. That is,
#                                
#                                instrumental_response_filepath = ["/path/to/response/matrix.txt","/path/to/particle/inputs.txt","/path/to/diagnostic/outputs.txt"]
#
#                                The first string is the filepath to the response matrix. The size of the matrix is 'ni x no', where 'ni' is the number of diagnostic input 
#                                grid points and 'no' is the number of output (actually being measured) grid points. The second string is the filepath to the input grid 
#                                points (vector). The third string is the filepath to the output grid points (vector). So, for example, for a proton recoil diagnostic, 
#                                the input should be incoming neutron energies (keV) and the output could be proton impact positions (e.g. cm). If, instead, the path to one 
#                                .jld2 file is specified, it should be specified as 
#
#                                instrumental_response_filepath = "/path/to/diagnostic/response/data.jld2"
#
#                                The keys of the .jld2-file should then be "response_matrix", "input" and "output". Input data should be a vector of length 'ni', output 
#                                data should be a vector of length 'no' and response_matrix should be a matrix of size 'ni x no'.
# instrumental_response_output_units - The units of measurement of the output grid points specified via the output in the 'instrumental_response_filepath' input variable.
#                                      Please see the OWCF/misc/convert_units.jl script for a list of all acceptable units in the OWCF - String

# flr_effects - If set to true, finite Larmor radius effects will be included in the weight function computations - Bool
# folderpath_o - The path to the folder where the results will be saved - String
# folderpath_OWCF - The path to the folder on your computer where the OWCF is installed - String
# gyro_samples - The number of points to discretize the gyro-motion for computation of synthetic spectra - Int64
# iiimax - If specified to be greater than 1, several copies of weight functions will be calculated. For comparison. - Int64
# iii_average - If set to true, an average of all the copies of weight functions will be computed. Saved without the "_i" suffix. - Bool
# nE - The number of fast-ion energy grid points in (E,p) space - Int64
# np - The number of fast-ion p grid points in (E,p) space - Int64
# p_array - The fast-ion p grid points of your (E,p) grid. If set to 'nothing': np, p_min and p_max must be specified - Vector
# p_min - The lower boundary for the (E,p) grid p values - Float64

# reaction - The nuclear fusion reaction that you want to simulate. Please see OWCF/misc/availReacts.jl for available fusion reactions - String

### Other
# If filepath_thermal_distr is not specified, then an interpolation object will be
# used as 'analytical' thermal temperature and thermal density profiles, respectively. The thermal_temp_axis
# and thermal_dens_axis variables will be used to scale the polynomial profiles to match the specified
# thermal temperature and thermal density at the magnetic axis. Please see the /misc/temp_n_dens.jl script for info.
