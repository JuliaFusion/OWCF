This is the Orbit Weights Computational Framework (OWCF).

It enables effective and efficient computation of orbit-space weight functions using the guiding-centre
computational framework (GCCF)(written in the Julia language) developed by Luke Stagner with 
additions by Henrik JÃ¤rleblad. The GCCF is comprised of the Julia packages EFIT.jl, Equilibrum.jl, 
GuidingCenterOrbits.jl and OrbitTomography.jl.

The OWCF computes fast-ion orbits in the (E,pm,Rm) orbit space, and feeds them as weighted (E,p,R,Z) data
into the forward model of your choice.

The OWCF also has the ability to compute simple forward model signals. This can be
done via the script calcSpec.jl (but not directly, please utilize a start script). In
normal fast-ion tomography, the main equation is

S = WF

where S is the forward model (or experimental) signal, W is the weight function that captures
all of the forward model into a simple matrix, and F is the fast-ion distribution reshaped
as a vector. To clarify, the OWCF thus has the ability to compute both S and W (both not
F). F needs to be provided as a TRANSP distribution, put into .jld2-format via getEpRzFIdistrFromTRANSP.jl
and then transformed to orbit space via ps2os.jl. You can also create your own fast-ion distribution in 
(E,p,R,z) or (E,pm,Rm) formats. As long as you save the fast-ion distribution with the same keys as required 
by e.g. ps2os.jl, it will be usable.

The OWCF_manual.pdf contains more detailed, and likely more up-to-date, information than this simple README.
Please consult the OWCF_manual.pdf document for more information on the OWCF. A publication on the OWCF
is in preparation and will be submitted to the journal of Computer Physics Communications. When published,
a link to the article will be included here.

To install:
For Windows, please follow the steps in howToInstallJuliaAndTheOWCF_Windows.pdf.
For Mac, please follow the steps in howToInstallJuliaAndTheOWCF_Mac.pdf

I highly recommend you read one of those .pdf documents before trying to install the OWCF.
If you really want to install the OWCF in a quick-and-dirty-and-risky way, do the following

*navigate to the OWCF folder using a terminal*
julia
> using Pkg
> Pkg.activate(".")
> ENV["PYTHON"] = "...path to your Python executable..."
> Pkg.add("PyCall")
> ENV["PYTHON"] = "...path to your Python executable..." # Often redundant
> Pkg.build("PyCall")
] instantiate
*wait for a long time*
Done!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To use the OWCF, find out which script you need.
Copy the template start file from the templates/ folder into the main OWCF/ folder.
Specify the required inputs. Execute. Get your output results file.
Visualze the results using any of the OWCF apps in apps/ or via a plot function in extra/gui.jl
Or manually, by writing the necessary code in e.g. scratch.jl.

Some scripts are executed without a template file. The input variables are then specified by modifying
the script directly.

If executing on a SLURM computational cluster, copy the .sh submit template you need from templates/ into
the main OWCF/ folder. Modify it as needed. Specify the same number of CPU cores in the start file. Submit
to the workload manager.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently supported forward models:

- The DRESS code [J. Eriksson et al, Computer Physics Communications, 199, 40-46, 2016]
The DRESS code is a code for computing the energy and momentum of fusion reaction products, given the collision
and fusing of two reacting nuclei. It also has the possibility to load, handle and use TRANSP data. Given a fusion 
reaction, it computes the resulting energy spectrum of the emitted particle (e.g. neutrons, gammas). It incorporates
diagnostic lines-of-sight via the input of data from the LINE21 code. The DRESS code is modular in the sense that 
any two-body fusion reaction can be added to the code, simply via defining the corresponding cross-sectional data.
As of this version of the OWCF and DRESS code, the DRESS code can only compute one-step fusion reactions. To upgrade
the OWCF and DRESS code to be able to handle two-step fusion reactions, it is supposed that the files fusreact.py, 
relkin.py and relscatt.py would need to be upgraded to compute a second, random step. Where the product particle 
of interest moves a short random distance in (R,phi,z), and then de-excites (or similar) and releases a gamma-photon
(for example).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently supported magnetic equilibrium files:

- .eqdsk/.geqdsk files.
These kind of files are used as input files to TRANSP. They contain information about the magnetic flux function 
and the tokamak geometry (first wall, divertor etc). For a full breakdown of what an .eqdsk/.geqdsk file usually
contains, and its structure, please examine the misc/eqdsk_file_breakdown.pdf file.

- .jld2 file
If the magnetic equilibrium is specified with a .jld2 file, as of the current version of the OWCF (v1.0), it has
to be an output file of the extra/compSolovev.jl script. Or have an equivalent structure and data content. 
The compSolovev.jl script provides the possibility to create customized Solov'ev magnetic equilibria.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRANSP .cdf/.CDF files:

- TRANSP shot files. They are usually saved on the form XXXXXAXX.cdf where 'X' can be any (different) numbers
and 'A' any letter. E.g. 94701V01.cdf, or 99965K71.cdf. These files is essentially the output file of the TRANSP
run with the same ID (e.g. 94701V01). They contain a multitude of data (hence, they are usually quite large) and
the OWCF only needs them for their thermal plasma density and temperature profiles (used by the DRESS code).

- TRANSP fast-ion shot files. They are usually computed using the NUBEAEM module of TRANSP. These files contain the
expected fast-ion distributions for the time points of interest. They contain fast-ion data but also time window
information data that the OWCF uses to select the corresponding thermal plasma density and temperature profiles.
These kind of files can be provided as input to the extra/getEpRzFIdistrFromTRANSP.jl script, which will convert
it to a .jld2 file with the fast-ion specified on a regular (E,p,R,z) grid.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently supported options for modelling diagnostic viewing cones:

- LINE21 (is that actually the name of the company?) output files. These have diagnostic viewing cone data 
organized into columns. The columns are, in order: x, y, z, c (angular weight), volume, ux (x component of vector
pointing towards the detector at the given x,y,z position), uy, uz, R, phi, solid angle. Talk to Massimo Nocente
or Jacob Eriksson to acquire LINE21 files for diagnostic viewing cones.

- No viewing cone. If no viewing cone file is specified, sperical emission is assumed (4*pi s.r.)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The main scripts of the OWCF include:

- calcEpRzTopoMap.jl
Compute orbit-type topological maps for a (E,p,R,z) grid. Including maps of poloidal and toroidal transit times,
if requested.
- calcOrbWeights.jl

coordinate values. The app will then re-compute new orbits and magnetic equilibria in real-time.
- distrWebApp.jl

An app that lets the user visualize orbit topological maps in (E,p,R,z) coordinate space. The option to
also visualize poloidal and toroidal transit times exists. The user can also choose to input a fast-ion 
distribution in (E,p,R,z) format. The app will then superimpose topological boundaries and the fast-ion
distribution can be visualzed via a toggle button.
- orbitsWebApp.jl
It is arguably the flagship app of the OWCF. It lets the user visualize fast-ion orbits interactively
via a topological map in (E,pm,Rm) space. Maps for poloidal and toroidal transit times can also be included.
The user can switch to (E,mu,Pphi;sigma) space via a toggle button.
- orbitWebApp.jl
A simple app that lets the user visualize a single fast-ion orbit in detail. The endpoint of the orbit can
be changed interactively. The coordinate space is (E,pm,Rm).
- signalWebApp.jl
An app that lets the user visualze a WF signal and orbit splits of WF, W and F, together with their dependence
on E, pm and Rm, respectively. Log-scales, splitting, fractions and more options can be changed interactively
via toggle buttons.
- weightsWebApp.jl
An app that lets the user interactively visualize the orbit weight functions of an orbit weight matrix.
The diagnostic measurement bin and fast-ion energy slice of interest are changed via sliders. A WF signal,
an S signal, a fast-ion distribution and null orbits can all be optionally included. The weight visualization
can be switched to (E,mu,Pphi;sigma) via a toggle button. Diagnostic viewing cones can be
optionally included.
- weightWebApp.jl
Please notice, no 's'. This app lets the user visualize the expected diagnostic signals of fast-ion orbits
The (E,pm,Rm) is navigated interactively via sliders and a topological map. Diagnostic viewing cones can be
optionally included.
